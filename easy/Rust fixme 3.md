This is my first tiem dealing with RUST, so i read outside resouses, writeups and AI.<br>



in order to solve this you need first to install rustc (rust compiler) to ur linux machine<br>

```
sudo apt install rustc 
```

edit src/main.rs:

```
subl src/main.rs # or
nano src/main.rs # or
code src/main.rs # or what ever code editer you have
```

than uncomment the <b>unsafe<b> function and its  }<br>

save ur work and make sure you are in fixme3 folder<br>

inside fixrus3 folder build Cargo

```
cargo build
```

after building Cargo, run it

```
cargo run
```

<sub>the flag should visible now</sub>

flag: picoCTF{*0w_*0u*3_f*x3*_1*3*_4*1}
<!--flag: picoCTF{n0w_y0uv3_f1x3d_1h3m_411} -->
