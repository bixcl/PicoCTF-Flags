endianness:<br>

```text
one of the best ctf i ever solve, it make me learn the convept of endian in computer,
1- to solver this prolem you shouls first understand endian concept
endiant convept where every hex numbers is suprated into group of 2,
left side to right side will be little endian and righ to left will be big endian,
2- to solve this you need first to reverse the word given, that will help you to get little endian first becouse they ask for it first
3- than convert the new word to hex and copy the result and paste it in the nc program
4- copy the flag and submit

the flag could be diffrent
picoCTF{3ndi4n_sw4p_su33ess_91bc76a4}
