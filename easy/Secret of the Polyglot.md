Secret of the Polyglot : this is an intersting one,<br>
1- open the pdf normaly and you will found part of the flag, if you try to read it you will notice that it said, "in png and pdf", that mean one part in png file and other is this that you are reading.<br>
2- to convert pdf file into png file you can use :
```bash
cp flag2of2-final.pdf flag.png

where flag2of2-final.pdf is the orginal pdf file and , flag.png is the converted fiel
```
3. after converting try to open png file and you will found that the other part of the flag is visible for you.<br>
4. marge them togather to form complete flag and submit.
```bash
picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_724b1287}
```
